# Computation of Flow Oscillation In Pipes
### **Background of Study**
> Sudden closure or opening of valve gives rise to a very high inertia pressure within the pipe
line. This is usually done by devices such as valves, pumps or any other mechanical
equipment which can disturb the steady state flow conditions can trigger oscillations of flow
from laminar region to turbulent region. Precautions must be taken to handle these transient
events and it can lead to catastrophic events. For example, a hydroelectric power plant in
Russia which is named as Sayano-Shushenskaya (2009) was completely destroyed due to
sudden stoppage of one of its turbines. At the end of this event, 76 people lost their lives and
approximately $310 million worth of damage was inflicted. 

### **Statement of Problem**
> Previous solutions to flow oscillation problems in pipes, assumed flow to be laminar
always or turbulent always. Whereas no surge flow is ever turbulent always, it will
also be laminar sometimes.
This would require a numerical approach for solving second order differential
equations, which is lengthy to achieve manually due to its iterative computations.
Hence, there is need for a suitable algorithm that can treat flow that oscillate between
laminar and turbulent regimes.

### **Aim and Objectives**
> The aim of this research is to develop an effective numerical method that can be used to
efficiently compute surges in pipes due to valve connecting two reservoirs being rapidly
opened, using a computer program developed in the Python environment.

### **Scope of Study**
> Unsteady-flow situations are more difficult to analyze than steady-flow situations. The
Bernoulli equation is not applicable and the equation of motion leads to a differential
equations for the velocity or pressure or head as a function of time. Numerical and graphical
methods are frequently resorted to, with the use of analog and digital computers to speed up
the process of finding solutions.

### **Significance of Study**
> There is no doubt that this program developed would assist students, researchers and
practicing engineers in the industry in surge computations.
